# MPC Reflection

## The Model
_Requirement: Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations._

## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

_Requirement: Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried._

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

_Requirement: A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described._

## Model Predictive Control with Latency

_Requirement: The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency._
